# Python Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game written in Python. It has a very simple rules engine. If it sees a spot where it can win, it goes there. If it sees a spot where it can block you, it goes there. It also has a function to automatically take the middle if it is available.

In recent commits, I've added code to stop you from using winning methods. Before the one that changed this file, it was still possible to beat it. Now, I think it's impossible. If you can beat it, tell me how.

__Hope you like it!__
